### Modal Interaction
JavaScript enables modal windows to appear when a project is clicked:

#### `script.js` 
```js
function openModal(title) {
  const modal = document.getElementById('modal');
  document.getElementById('modal-title').textContent = title;
  modal.classList.remove('hidden');
}

function closeModal() {
  document.getElementById('modal').classList.add('hidden');
}
